> Palmer penguin R package contains two datasets: `penguins_raw` and `penguins`. Today weâ€™ll focus on a curated subset of the raw data in the package named `penguins` and as you can see from their name, penguins is pre-processed data.  

Lets go through each stage of the data science project first! 

- Import
- Tidy
- Transform
- Visualise
- Model (Not using that today!)
- Communicate

# Import:  Load dataset and library on workspace.

- After installing the packages, you can load them by using the `library` function.

- There are two R packages that are used to transform and visualise data : `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. You can find these two combined with various other packages in `tidyverse`

- The dataset from the R package can be loaded using `data()`. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins) # for data
library(tidyverse) # for data-handling & visualisation
data(penguins) # load pre-processed penguins 
view(penguins)
```


# Tidy 

The data we have is already preprocessed therefore it is in tidy format. 


# Summary of Dataset

- Before doing anything, we should first see the summary of Dataset! 


```{r glimpse}
glimpse(penguins)

```

The data has 344 rows or observations and 8 variables. 


- Get data dictionary from the help file. Try ?penguins

```{r summary}
summary(penguins)
```
### What do you gather from here?

- The data gathered is from 2007-2009
- Three species : Adelie , Chinstrap, Gentoo
- 3 Island : Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen
- Has some unknown values  

### You can visualise the data as a whole as well 

```{r visdat}
#install.packages(visdat)
visdat::vis_dat(penguins)
```


# Transform

- select desired variables & filter out unknowns. You can also create new variables from existing variables. 

```{r transform}
data_subset<- penguins%>%
  select(species,bill_depth_mm,flipper_length_mm,bill_length_mm)%>%
  filter(!is.na(flipper_length_mm),!is.na(bill_depth_mm),!is.na(bill_length_mm))%>%
  mutate(ratio=bill_depth_mm/bill_length_mm)
```


# Visualise 

- You can use functions from ggplot2 package to create various visualisations. 

- ggplot() creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to. The first argument of ggplot() is the dataset to use in the graph. 

- ggplot2 comes with many geom functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot.

- Each geom function in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument. This defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties.

- The mapping argument is always paired with aes(), and the x and y arguments of aes() specify which variables to map to the x and y axes.

- You can also tweek the vis by adding other aesthetics by including things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points/graph.

```{r density-flip}
  ggplot(data_subset)+
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x=flipper_length_mm,fill=species),alpha=0.5)+
  ggtitle("Flipper Length of different species")
```

- Alpha argument here controls the shading 

You can do the same thing with histogram!

```{r histogram-flip}
data_subset%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=flipper_length_mm,fill=species),alpha=0.8)+
  ggtitle("Flipper Length of different species")
```


###  What do you gather from this?

- Flipper length seperates Gentoo from the others. Adelie and Chinstrap are more similar in that regard. 

### Your turn : Density plot of Bill length of different species and what do you gather from it

```{r density-bill, eval=FALSE}
data_subset%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x=.....,fill=species),alpha=0.5)+
  ggtitle("Bill Length of different species")
```

Set the chunk options as eval = TRUE when you are ready to include the output of this code in your report. 

### What do you gather from this?

Answer here ! 
 

### Lets take a closer look at flipper length 

```{r flip-boxcox}
data_subset%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x=species,y=flipper_length_mm),fill="blue",alpha=0.5)+
  ggtitle("Comparison of flipper Length of different species")
```


### How to interpret a boxplot ?

### How does the bill vary between species ?

- You can give color to different species to see the underlying patterns. 


```{r scatterplot}
penguins%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=bill_length_mm,y=bill_depth_mm,color=species),shape=16)+
  ggtitle("Comparing different species wrt bill Length & depth")
```
- shape argument assigns shapes to these points. If you dont want a dot you can choose the code shown below to pick any particular shape you want.

### What do you gather from this?

- Adelie has a shorter bill length but a deeper bill. The opposite applies for Gentoo and Chinstrap is somehwere in the middle.
